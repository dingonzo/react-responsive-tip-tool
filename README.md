# Tip-Calculator
Front-End Styling Highlights
This project demonstrates advanced CSS3 techniques to provide a professional user experience:

*   **Modern Layouts**: Leverages **CSS Grid** for the main dual-column container and **Flexbox** for alignment within the results section.
*   **Responsive Design**: Includes a `@media` breakpoint at 600px to ensure the interface remains user-friendly on mobile devices by switching to a single-column stack.
*   **Visual Fidelity**: 
    *   Implements **Smooth Transitions** (0.5s ease-in-out) for interactive button states.
    *   Uses **Box Shadows** and **Border Radii** for a modern "Card" UI aesthetic.
    *   Features **Custom Input Styling** to provide a clean look by hiding default browser spin-buttons.
*   **State-Linked Classes**: Uses dynamic class assignment (e.g., `.select`) to provide immediate visual feedback when a tip percentage is chosen.
